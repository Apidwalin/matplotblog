Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. With this open-source Python visualization library, you can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, error charts, scatter plots, and so on - with just a few lines of code. 

From time to time, we'd like to show our readers what can be done with matplotlib through a series of useful tutorials posted here to our blog. 

We'd also love to read about what you can do with matplotlib as well. 

You can submit blog articles for consideration by submitting a pull request on Github at https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotblog.
