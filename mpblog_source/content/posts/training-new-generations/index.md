Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. With this open-source Python visualization library, you can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code. 

From time to time, we'd like to show our readers what can be done with matplotlib through a series of useful tutorials posted here to our blog. 

We'd love to see what you can do with matplotlib as well. 

The matplotlib project is located at https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib. 
See https://matplotlib.org/devel/index.html for directions on how you can contribute.
